## Steps to do Warchall challenges
---
1) First thing first is of course to create an account on https://wechall.net/register
2) After the registration steps done, click on the 'Challenges' and look for `Warchall(11)` or immediatly via the link mentioned here https://www.wechall.net/challs/Warchall/by/chall_score/ASC/page-1.
3) Click now on the first chapiter of the challenge which is 'Trainning : Warchall - The beginning' to begin the CTF.
4) Now, create an ssh account in order to log on the warchall box server to do all warchall challenges. Make sure you have a strong password enough to be able to get an ssh account.
5) Then log on `warchall.net` server on your terminal via ssh using this command below :
```sh
ssh -p 19198 username@warchall.net
```
For example, my username is 'abega' so the syntax will be like this below :
```sh
ssh -p 19198 abega@warchall.net
```
Then enter the password you've just created. There you go and welcome now to this challenge.
