# Level 05
---
As we know,  solution can be found int the directory ```/home/level```. 
There, we can finde a directory named ```05_privacy```.
```sh
yourUsername@warchall:/home/level$ ls -al
    ...
drwxr-xr-x  2 root    root    4096 Feb 12  2023 05_privacy
    ...
```
Now you just have to look what's inside and read the only file you can find there which is the file ```README.md```
```sh
yourUsername@warchall:/home/level$ cat 05_privacy/README.md
```
There you go ! You have solved all of the chapiter one now!
